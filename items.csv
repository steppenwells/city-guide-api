Orange Pekoe, a speciality tea room and cafe in the modern style – all jazzy, expensive wallpapers and tastefully deployed vintage chintz – exudes that gentle atmosphere. Its calm cheerfulness is particularly welcome over breakfast. The morning menu stretches from freshly baked pastries to Scottish smoked salmon and cream cheese on toasted muffins, and includes the Pekoe Florentine (£6), where the expected hollandaise is replaced (presumably with calorie-counting yummy mummies in mind) with fresh spinach and a dressing of olive oil. Elsewhere, the daytime menu runs the tarts-salads-sandwiches gamut, with everything from breads to pies made from scratch on site. <br/><br/>• White Hart Lane, SW13 (+44 (0) 20-8876 6070, <a href=""http://orangepekoeteas.com"">orangepekoeteas.com</a>)",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/4/20/1303294977403/Orange-Pekoe-001.jpg,,Tony Naylor,http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tonynaylor,http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/apr/08/west-london-budget-restaurants-food,Top 10 cheap eats in West London

Like the sandwich, pizza is at its best when it is kept to a few superb ingredients, and Santa Maria's bufalina exemplifies this. The base is foldable, paper thin in the middle, expertly charred and ringed with a springy edge. Essentially, it's a shallow pool of vibrant, seasoned tomato pulp and exquisite, melting buffalo milk mozzarella.

On Saturdays, it takes place on a lot in Fort Greene (<em>176 Lafayette Ave</em>), while on Sundays it camps out on the Williamsburg waterfront (<em>27 North 6th St</em>). Once the weather turns cold, from Thanksgiving through March, the action moves indoors to the lobby of One Hanson, a spectacular landmarked building also known as the Williamsburg Savings Bank.

The rear parlour also has Victorian-era seating and overlooks the back garden. Just a couple subway stops away are the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and the Prospect Park Zoo. <br/><br/>

Walking up is not recommended, not least because the best part of the show is often in the elevator where video and sound art are presented. Artists presented investigate politics, culture and ecology in works often produced as part of the gallery's residency programme. Less concerned with the art market, they produce more ephemeral works, using new media and venturing into public art.<br/><br/>

A disk in the floor marks the ideal spot from which to experience the illusion. Further down the nave, another marker signals the best vantage point for a second bit of trickery.

Annoyingly, the only way to see the equally original interior of the church is when it opens for mass on Sundays 10am-noon.

For many years it was cool precisely because it didn't try too hard: an unreconstructed neighbourhood bar whose outside tables were frequented by wizened, chain-smoking Roman chess players, it was a <em>fico</em> sort of place to meet for aperitivi with friends. But a two-year makeover that finished in September 2010 made the decor <em>fico, </em>too, in a shabby-chic French bistro kind of way, arguably reducing Fico's true cool quotient. Still, it's all done with a certain panache, the new all-you-can-eat aperitivo buffet (free with a €5 glass of wine or a €8 cocktail) is well-attended – and crucially, the chess players are still there, oblivious to fashion shifts.

In the far northern reaches of the Prati district, this wine emporium and lunch stop opened in 1927, and the charming bottle-shop decor has changed little since then. Run by the personable Benito, Carso is frequented by local residents, lawyers from the area's many legal offices, and TV people from the nearby RAI state TV and radio studios. Bus drivers and mechanics used to add some colour to the mix, too, until the bus depot across the road closed down. But it's still about as far as you can get from tourist Rome, and the wine list is encyclopaedic (and made even better by Benito's promise that he'll open any bottle you like, even if you only want one glass). Food, served mostly at lunchtime (though there's an aperitivo buffet for evening grazing), consists mostly of salads, cold cuts (bresaola, cheeses) and the occasional hot dish, like <em>involtini di vitello</em> (veal rolls). Though it's closed on Italian football's canonical match day, Sunday, Enoteca Carso's proximity to the Stadio Olimpico, home to Roma and Lazio, makes it a good pre-match stop if you're taking in a weekday evening fixture.<br/><br/>• Viale Carso 37/39, +39 06 372 5866.

It deserves a medal for keeping standards high in an area where tourist rip-off joints have become the rule. The few simple pavement tables are much sought after; in the long, narrow interior with its big counter full of interesting cheeses and cured meats, diners and imbibers sit on communal wooden tables under towering bottle-filled shelves. The vast selection of Italian wines here has few rivals in Rome. A glass of local white starts at around €2.30, but if you're into wine ask the knowledgeable staff to suggest something a little more refined (there are dozens of by-the-glass options, going up to €8, though you'll get more choice and better value if you order a bottle).

A cavernous underground space has a bierkeller air with Alpine decor and beer-bottle-lined walls. Upstairs is altogether more Roman, with wines filling high wooden shelves and rickety wooden tables being congenially shoved back and forth by passing waiters as they struggle to hitch bottles down for clients; even better, a few outside tables give a front-row view of neighbourhood life on Testaccio's market square. During the day L'Oasi functions as a takeaway bottle-shop, but from 5.30pm staff begin piling up a long table of substantial nibbles to accompany the aperitivi of homeward-bound students and workers; at €10 for a glass of wine or beer and a plate of goodies, this buffet – available until 8.30pm – is an excellent way to dine cheaply.

Since the Wall fell, the set has been left to rot and the Berlin senate has still not decided what to do with this prime bit of real estate.

The fact Dracula was based on Vlad Tepes, who liked nothing better than impaling Turks, added still more spice. And they didn’t stop there.

The Greek film Politiki Kouzina, which translates as “Constantinople cooking”, briefly united Greeks and Turks around a box of Kleenex and launched a string of soap operas in both countries in which a Greek girl/boy falls in love with a Turkish boy/girl with predictably complicated consequences. The story of a young boy forced to leave Turkey in one of the last deportations of the city’s age-old Greek population, in the 1960s, hit a raw nerve in both countries. Boulmetis, who wrote and directed the film, was born in Kadiköy’s marvellous market, on the Asian side of the city, before his family were forced to leave for Athens, where he was “treated as a Turk”. In other words, not unlike a Kurd in Istanbul… Yesim Ustaoglu’s Journey to the Sun (1999) gives a good idea of what that can be like.

Gay life in Turkey often confounds the cliches, with transvestites once marching in full veil to protest at how young, covered women are still excluded from some universities. <br/><br/>• Beyoğlu",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2011/9/9/1315587259850/Hamam-001.jpg,,Fiachra Gibbons,http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/fiachragibbons,http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/sep/14/10-best-films-movies-istanbul

Fatih Akin’s passionate survey of Istanbul’s musical melting pot grabs you by the lapels from the first shot and never lets go. It kicks off at the Grand Hotel Londres in Beyoğlu, where Akin’s equally frenetic feature Head-On (2004) finished with a love scene worthy of Last Tango in Paris. All, or almost all, cultural life is here, from Orhan Gencebay, a cinema action hero as well as musical genius, to gecekondu  (hastily assembled squatter houses) shanty-town rappers to the sublime Roma clarinetist Selim Sesler. Akin’s The Edge of Heaven (2007) could also have easily made the top 10.

Edinburgh,Where to stay,Boutique,Tigerlily,http://www.tigerlilyedinburgh.co.uk,55.952131,-3.20647,"Behind the graceful facade of yet another Grade A-listed Georgian building, within teetering distance of the city centre's boutiques and bars, is one of the grooviest hotels in the capital. Tigerlily has a tangible sense of fun and bags of bling – a mirrored mosaic wall in the bar, shocking pink bar stools, a giant cloud light plus rotating disco balls. The 33 individually designed rooms are luxuriously decked out with vivid Designers Guild fabrics, bespoke four-posters, mirrored console tables and Perspex chairs. To get the party started there are pre-loaded iPods and straightening irons as well as a hairdryer – you've got to love that, and in the basement, Lulu's nightclub.<br/><br/>

Edinburgh,Where to stay,Boutique,Le Monde,http://www.lemondehotel.co.uk,55.953429,-3.196124,"George Street is high-street chic by day, and high-heeled hectic hedonism by night. At the other end of the street from Tigerlily is Le Monde. The 18 rooms and suites are named after cities and styled accordingly. Paris is all fancy swirls and ornate gilt and burgundy flourishes, New York is a classic Manhattan loft apartment with exposed brickwork and parquet flooring while Los Angeles has white leather sofas and framed photos of Hollywood stars. The nightclub in the basement is called Shanghai … you get the drift. The theme might be a little overdone but it works.

Edinburgh,Where to stay,Boutique,The Bonham,http://www.townhousecompany.com/thebonham,55.951459,-3.214452,"The Town House Company once owned a clutch of hotels in Scotland's capital: alongside The Bonham, there was The Howard, Channings and the Edinburgh Residence. However, after catapulting glitzy Blythswood Square in Glasgow on to the hotel scene two years ago, the company sold its smaller properties to concentrate on the two boldest. The Bonham is an understated 19th-century Victorian townhouse – housing a psychedelic sea of colour. You'll need your sunglasses in the foyer: think warm wood-panelling, purple and grey checked carpet, a vivid crimson spiral sofa and modern artworks. There are 48 rooms to choose from – but only one has a decadent freestanding Edwardian copper bathtub. <br/><br/>

Edinburgh,Where to stay,Boutique,The Glasshouse,http://www.theetoncollection.co.uk,55.957081,-3.185377,"Behind a 150-year-old church facade at the top of Leith Walk is one of Edinburgh's more unusual boutique hotels: The Glasshouse has a dining room (where breakfast is served) but no restaurant or bar, although you can order 24-hour room service. Not that the lack of restaurant is a hardship with so many gourmet options nearby – just a slight quirk. Apart from that the 66 rooms and suites are slick and sleek with the usual high thread counts and downy duvets as well as floor to ceiling windows looking out over the city or on to the two-acre lavender-swathed roof garden. The suites also come with a complimentary decanter of whisky in case you fancy a nightcap.<br/><br/>

Edinburgh,Where to stay,Boutique,Number Ten Edinburgh,http://www.numbertenedinburgh.com,55.956624,-3.207046,"Number Ten is, unsurprisingly, at number 10 on Gloucester Place. It's an unobtrusive, genteel address: a Grade A-listed building on a gracious, cobbled New Town street on the edge of the leafy, village-chic of Stockbridge with its boutiques, delis and cafes. The interiors, however, are in sharp contrast to the historic facade. Black is the predominant colour. The carpet is black and white striped, the original shutters are painted black, chairs in the restaurant and bar are black velvet. There are 28 rooms and suites with Philippe Starck bathrooms and decorated out with imported antique Chinese furniture – in black. Yet although the design is quite masculine, the tranquil location and historic house ambience soften the overall effect.<br/><br/>
